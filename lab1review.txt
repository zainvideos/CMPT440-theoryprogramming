The essays address the questions; however, they are shorter than what it was
required.

The DFA is lacking the following:
- states that specifically address all the possible symbols that can be
  observed at any given state.
- error states or non-accepting states when you receive other symbol different
  from the one you expect to receive.
- arrows going to the error state(s); remember that at every state you can
  actually get any symbol from the alphabet $\Sigma$.
- an arrow indicating where everything starts; it is convention to do so.
- proper handling of spaces, e.g., for[space](...

You could use $\Sigma$ more to save some space. Lets say that you want to make
an arrow if the next symbol is not an 'f', you could simply say $\{\Sigma - f\}$,
which means the set of all possible symbols of the whole alphabet minus 'f'.
